"""Test suite for AI Engineering brief builder.

This test suite validates the brief builder system following best practices
from "AI Engineering" by Chip Huyen. We test:
- Configuration loading and validation
- API interactions (mocked)
- Input/output validation
- Error handling and retry logic
- Metrics calculation

The tests use pytest with mocking to avoid actual API calls during testing.
